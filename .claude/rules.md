**Format Example:**
```markdown
**Griffith Observatory** ⭐

- 🔗 [Official Website](https://griffithobservatory.org)
- FREE admission to observatory and grounds
```

**Google Maps Link Format (MANDATORY):**
- **ALWAYS use:** `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=[Location+Name+City+State]`
- Include location name, city, and state/country for accuracy
- Replace spaces with `+` signs
- Remove special characters (ampersands, commas, etc.)

- ❌ `https://www.google.com/maps/search/...` (without api=1)
- ❌ `https://www.google.com/maps/dir/...`
