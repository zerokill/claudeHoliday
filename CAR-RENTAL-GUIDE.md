---

## 🚙 What Vehicle Do You Need?

### Recommended: **Full-Size SUV or Minivan**

**Why:**

- ✅ 2 car seats (5-year-old booster + 18-month-old car seat)
- ✅ Stroller, diaper bag, toys, snacks
- ✅ Comfortable for long drives
- ✅ Better visibility on highway
- ✅ More storage than sedan

**Vehicle Options:**

| Vehicle Class | Examples | Pros | Cons | Price/Day |
|---------------|----------|------|------|-----------|

| **Mid-Size SUV** | Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue | Good space, better gas mileage (~$500) | Might feel cramped with luggage | $60-90 |
| **Minivan** ⭐⭐ | Chrysler Pacifica, Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna | BEST for families! Sliding doors, tons of space | Less "cool" factor | $70-100 |
| **Large Sedan** ❌ | Toyota Camry, Honda Accord | Cheaper | NOT enough space for 21 days | $50-70 |

**BEST CHOICE: Minivan or Full-Size SUV**

**Drop fees vary by:**

---

### Strategy 4: Round-Trip BUT Modify Route

**Route:** SF → Monterey → LA → Vegas → **Fly to Fresno** → Yosemite → **Zion** → SF

**This reverses Zion and Yosemite!**

**How it works:**
