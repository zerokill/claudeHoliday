## Highlights

### General Sherman Tree
- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=General+Sherman+Tree+Sequoia+National+Park+CA)

- Estimated 2,200 years old
- Short paved walk to the tree (0.8 km from parking, downhill going in)

> **Kid-Friendly:** This will blow everyone's minds! The sheer size is almost incomprehensible. The walk is paved but steep coming back up - carrier for the 18-month-old recommended.
